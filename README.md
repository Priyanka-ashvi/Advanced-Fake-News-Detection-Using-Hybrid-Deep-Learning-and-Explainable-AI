# Advanced-Fake-News-Detection-Using-Hybrid-Deep-Learning-and-Explainable-AI
The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated fake news detection system that 
combines advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques. By 
integrating XLNet for superior language understanding, FastText for efficient word
representation, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for robust feature extraction, the 
system aims to enhance detection accuracy. Additionally, incorporating Explainable AI 
techniques, particularly SHAP, will provide clear and interpretable explanations of the model's 
predictions. This dual focus on performance and transparency seeks to create a reliable tool for 
identifying misinformation, ultimately fostering greater public trust in digital information 
sources.Identify fake news and real news using algorithms like bert,Roberta,Xlnet,Explainable AI with Shap and Nlp techniques on tested data.

Based on the results obtained from the study on advancing fake news detection using hybrid 
deep learning models combined with FastText and Explainable AI, several key conclusions can 
be drawn. The proposed hybrid models have demonstrated exceptional performance in 
detecting fake news, achieving high levels of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores across 
multiple configurations.The hybrid model combining FastText with CNN showcased robust 
performance, with minimal misclassifications, indicating its efficacy in capturing and 
differentiating nuanced patterns within the data. 
The Roberta model further enhanced detection accuracy, reinforcing the value of integrating 
state-of-the-art models in improving the reliability of fake news detection systems.In 
conclusion, the study validates the effectiveness of hybrid deep learning models in fake news 
detection, offering a promising avenue for future research and implementation in real-world 
scenarios. The integration of explainable AI further enhances the credibility and trustworthiness 
of these models, making them valuable tools in the ongoing fight against misinformation.
